Hello and welcome to Developer Student Club (DSC) Api Workshop. Today, let's explore on the concept of API's (Application Programming Interface).

Slides for this workshop is located [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n534cOfTUncHwR44fZR5vChqKCD8tLFvMx8ZlVwDzPs/edit).

The [Starter-Code](https://github.com/DSC-CSUF/api-workshop/tree/master/Starter-Code) file contains the code that we will be following during the workshop.

The [WeatherAPI](https://github.com/DSC-CSUF/api-workshop/tree/master/WeatherAPI) file contains the finish product, so you can look back and check to see if you made any mistakes.

## To download the code for this workshop, Copy and Paste this command into terminal;

`git clone https://github.com/DSC-CSUF/api-workshop.git`

## For students using Tuffix/Mac/Linux, use the following commands to view your update your browser while you code

* ### Install *browser-sync* by copying this command into terminal: 

  * `sudo npm install -g browser-sync`

* ### After browser-sync is installed, use this command to view your project on Google Chrome:
  * `browser-sync start --server --browser "Google Chrome" --files "stylesheets/*.css, *.html"`
 
* ### If Chrome is your default browser, then use this:
  * `browser-sync start --server --files "stylesheets/*.css, *.html"`
  
## For students using Windows, after you download this repository on your computer, you should be able to view your project on chrome by clicking index (which is your index.html):
